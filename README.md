# Aloha Chat Landing Page

A fictious startup for the entrepreneurship class during my summer school stay at Metropolia University of Applied Sciences in Helsinki, Finland.

Meant to be a chat app to connect people based on common interests, the app aims to go against the superficial image-based connection apps by connecting people on things they truly care about.
